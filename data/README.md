* **LAION-Glyph 10M**

There are 10 files in total. Each contains 1M samples with the same format like LAION-Glyph 1M.
File name: ```LAION-Glyph-10M_x.json```. (x = 0-9)

[**Notes**]
* Since each json file has large size (~100GB), it would be better to split each json file into multiple (e.g., 10 or 100) json files with smaller size.
